<!-- <p>London, UK
During my undergrad years, I spend 5 months studying in England. Technically, I lived in Hampton Wick, a southwestern suburb of London that sits along the Thames and is walking distance from Hampton Court Palace, home of Henry VIII.

					<p class="intro">Though most of my extended family is from Missouri, I was born in Boulder, Colorado, at Boulder County Hospital. My mother lived in Boulder for a few years in the early 1980s, but we returned to Missouri early enough in my live that I don't have any recollection of living there. Still, it's a beautiful place that I still like to claim as my original home. We returned frequently over the years to visit family friends, and to explore Boulder Canyon and nearby Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>
